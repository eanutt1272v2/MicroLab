# MicroLab

This repository contains the source Processing files for MicroLab, a particle simulation software that demonstrates complex emergent behavior and forms life-like structures. The project is currently under active development.

## Features

-   **Particle Simulation**: Simulates particles with emergent behaviors.
-   **Life-like Structures**: Demonstrates the formation of complex, self-organising patterns.
-   **Processing-based**: Built using the Processing development environment.

## Technologies Used

-   **Processing**: A flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

## Up and Running

1.  Download the ZIP file from the repository **OR** git clone to a folder and then skip to **Step 3**.
2.  Extract the files.
3.  Open the extracted folder in your Processing IDE.
4.  Ensure all `.pde` files are present (GUI.pde, Manager.pde, MicroLab.pde, Mouse.pde, Particle.pde, Type.pde).
5.  You should be able to run the software.
